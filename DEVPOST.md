# EcoTrace 🌿

## AI-Powered Environmental Impact Analysis

---

## 🎯 The Problem

Businesses, project managers, and individuals often struggle to understand the environmental footprint of their projects **before** they begin. Traditional environmental assessments are:

- **Expensive** — requiring specialized consultants
- **Time-consuming** — taking weeks or months to complete
- **Inaccessible** — not available to small businesses or individual creators

This lack of accessible tooling means many projects proceed without understanding their true environmental cost, missing opportunities for sustainable alternatives.

## 💡 Our Solution: EcoTrace

**EcoTrace** is a web-based tool that provides **instant, AI-powered environmental impact analysis** for any project. Users simply input their project details — type, size, location, materials, energy sources, and a description — and receive a comprehensive breakdown including:

- ✅ **CO₂ Footprint Estimate** (tons/year)
- ✅ **Energy Usage Projection** (MWh/year)
- ✅ **Sustainability Risk Rating** (Low / Medium / High)
- ✅ **Material Impact Distribution** (visual breakdown)
- ✅ **Energy Source Analysis** (comparative chart)

By leveraging **Perplexity AI**, EcoTrace goes beyond static calculations. It interprets project descriptions contextually — recognizing eco-friendly practices like "reclaimed wood" or flagging high-impact choices like "coal-powered grid" — to deliver **nuanced, realistic estimates**.
